First challenge for the INFO343 course
*Hi, Andrew. I'm Yutong Pan. You can also call me Angel. I have absolutely no coding experience before except java. So please bear with me and I will be asking plenty of questions. It is a pleasure to take this class and I will try me best to study and succeed. Thank you*
